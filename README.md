# image-classification-example

This is a simple image classification example for 10 types of Fruits as listed below,  that uses Google's Machine Learning library Tensorflow, Keras as Frontend and a pre-trained Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network model called Inception.

1. Apple
2. Banana
3. Orange
4. Papaya
5. Kiwi
6. Strawberry
7. Grapes
8. Mango
9. Pomegranate
10. Pineapple

This model has been pre-trained for the 1,000 different classes of images from ImageNet Datasets. The program applies Transfer Learning to this existing model and re-trains it to classify above set of images for Fruits.
